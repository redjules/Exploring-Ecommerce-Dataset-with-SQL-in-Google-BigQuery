# Exploring Ecommerce Dataset with SQL in Google BigQuery

# Overview
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

# Dataset
We have a newly available ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into a table in BigQuery. 

In this project, we use a copy of that dataset. Sample scenarios are provided, from which you look at the data and ways to remove duplicate information. 

# Goals

In this project, we use BigQuery to:

- Access an ecommerce dataset
- Look at the dataset metadata
- Remove duplicate entries
- Write and execute queries

# Snapshots
